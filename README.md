### Abstract

### Introduction
We were given 2 collection of datasets containing information about stock markets and earthquakes. Stock datasets consisted of 16 csv files, containing daily values of 12 different stock market indices going from August 2008 to July 2023, together almost 45000 rows and 8 columns. The Earthquake file covered earthquakes around the world from 1990 to 2023, and contained various characteristics such as locaiton, magnitude, depth, etc. We were asked to add at least two other datasets.

The issues we faced were:
- How to connect the data sets
- How to upload the data sets in GitHub
