## Abstract:  
We develop a prediction model for Stock Market Trends based on Global Events (in this case, Natural Disaster: Earthquake). Our model aims to show how earthquakes, especially major ones, impact global markets. By comparing earthquake data with stock market trends, we want to help investors, economists, and decision-makers understand how earthquakes may change market behavior. This will help them see risks/chances more clearly and make better decisions. 

## Overview:

We received 16 datasets containing information about Stock market data (from 2008 to 2023) and Earthquake data (from 1990 to 2023). 
The key questions we want to solve are: 
1.	How is the impact of natural disasters on the stock market - in the short and long term?
2.	Are there specific sectors (e.g., energy, real estate, insurance, ...) or regions that are more sensitive to earthquakes in terms of market performance?
3.	…
