## Abstract:  

We develop a prediction model for Stock Market Trends based on Global Events (in this case, Natural Disaster: Earthquake). Our model aims to show how earthquakes, especially major ones, impact global markets. By comparing earthquake data with stock market trends, we want to help investors, economists, and decision-makers understand how earthquakes may change market behavior. This will help them see risks/chances more clearly and make better decisions. 

## Overview:

We received 16 datasets containing information about Stock market data (from 2008 to 2023) and Earthquake data (from 1990 to 2023). 
The key questions we want to solve are: 
1.	How is the impact of natural disasters on the stock market - in the short and long term?
2.	Are there specific sectors (e.g., energy, real estate, insurance, ...) or regions that are more sensitive to earthquakes in terms of market performance?
3.	How can investors apply this model? 

## How to use/read this Project code? 
 
- Firstly, some library need to be installed: pandas, numpy, statsmodels.api, geocoder, datetime, yfinance, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, requests, glob, dash, plotly.
- Secondly, the data sources: 
    + Raw data (01_data\01_raw): ...
    + Additional data (01_data\03_additional): from yfinance and google (national stock exchange websites)

### Part 1: Regression Analysis




### Part 2: Market Analysis

1. Run the file: "01_preparation.ipynb" (in 02_code\0_preprocess) to retrieve the csv file "clean_major_earthquakes.csv" (in 01_data\02_pre). This "clean_major_earthquakes.csv" includes earthquake from 2008-2023, magnitudo >= 6

2. Run the file: "03_N225_companies_stock.ipynb" (in 02_code\0_preprocess\03_N225_companies_stock.ipynb) to retrieve the csv file "N225_companies_stock.csv" (in 01_data\02_pre). This "N225_companies_stock.csv" includes all 225 companies stock value (open, close, volume) of ^N225 (Nikkei 225, Japan Market). 

3. Run the file "03_N225_and_major_earthquake.ipynb" (in 02_code\1_analysis) to get the analysis of Market Performance (in here is Japan Market) and the Time for the Market to recover from the Earthquake. 

4. Do the same step 2 and 3 above for the rest markets : N100 (Europe), China, BSESN (India), NSEI (India).
